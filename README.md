# BCG Data Science Job Simulation on Forage.Com

### Problem Statement
The client is a major gas and electricity utility company, supplying energy to corporate, SME, and residential customers. The company is experiencing a significant churn problem, primarily in the SME segment. This issue is driven by the power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe.

BCG has been engaged to assist with the SME segment, as the client believes it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The initial hypothesis is that churn is driven by customer price sensitivity, and the client is considering a discounting strategy. The head of the SME division suggests that offering customers with a high propensity to churn a 20% discount may be an effective solution.

## Tasks Breakdown
### Task 1: Business Understanding and Hypothesis Framing
#### Objective: Define the business problem and hypothesize the factors influencing customer churn.
#### Hypothesis: Churn is primarily driven by customer price sensitivity, and a discount may reduce churn rates.

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Objective: Conduct a thorough analysis of the provided dataset to understand customer demographics, behaviors, and other relevant factors.
#### Key Insights: Visualization of customer behavior, identification of potential churn indicators, and exploration of pricing sensitivity trends.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modelling
#### Objective: Engineer relevant features from the dataset and build a predictive model to identify customers with a high propensity to churn.
#### Approach: Applied various machine learning models to predict churn likelihood and assess the impact of price sensitivity.

### Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
#### Findings: The model successfully identified customers likely to churn based on price sensitivity and other factors.
#### Recommendations: Offering a 20% discount to high-propensity customers may reduce churn, but further testing is recommended to validate the strategy's effectiveness.
